    <!--CSS Layout - width and max-width-->

    <!--Using width, max-width and margin:auto;
    
        As mentioned in the previous chapter; a block-level element always takes up
        the full width avalibale (streches out to the left and right as far as it can).

        Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching
        out to the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto, to
        horizontally center the element within its container. The element will take up
        the specified width, and the remaning space will be split equally between the two margins:

            This <div> element has a width of 500px, and margin set to auto.
        
        Note: The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window
        is smaller than the width of the element. The browser then adds a horizontal
        scrollbar to the page.

        Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's 
        handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on 
        small devices:

        The <div> element has a maz-width of 500px, and margin set
        to auto.

        Tip: Resize the browser window to less than 500px wide, to see the
        difference between the two divs!

    <h2>CSS Max-width</h2>

<div class="ex1">This div element has width: 500px;</div>
<br>

<div class="ex2">This div element has max-width: 500px;</div>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between 
the two divs!</p>
